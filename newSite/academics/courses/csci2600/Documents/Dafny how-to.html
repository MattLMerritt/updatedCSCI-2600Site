<p>To help those of you who wanted to use a standalone version of Dafny (as opposed to a Web page front-end which can get slow or unresponsive) on a Windows system but were having some issues, here is a short tutorial.<br><br><h1>A mini how-to Using Dafny in Windows</h1><br /><span style="font-family: courier new , courier;">Monospaced font</span> denotes the characters that you need to type in literally, file names/paths, UI control names, or the output of your commands.<br><br>1) Navigate to <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/dafny/releases" title="Microsoft/dafny" target="_blank"><span style="font-family: courier new , courier;">https://github.com/Microsoft/dafny/releases</span></a><br>2) Download the latest Dafny release for Windows (as of the time of writing, it is 3.1.0, i.e., the file to download is <span style="font-family: courier new , courier;">dafny-3.1.0-x64-win.zip</span>).<br>3) Right-click on the downloaded ZIP file and select <span style="font-family: courier new , courier;">Properties</span>.<br>4) In the lower right corner of the <span style="font-family: courier new , courier;">Properties</span> window you should see an unchecked <span style="font-family: courier new , courier;">Unblock</span> checkbox.<br>5) Check this box and click <span style="font-family: courier new , courier;">OK</span>. (Once checked, this box disappears from the <span style="font-family: courier new , courier;">Properties</span> window; so if you open up the <span style="font-family: courier new , courier;">Properties</span> again, you will no longer see that box; this is normal.) Checking this box tells Windows that you trust the source from which you acquired this ZIP file and you allow Windows to run this software.<br>6) Unpack the contents of the ZIP file to a folder on your local machine.<br>7) Launch the command prompt or a PowerShell window. As usual, there are multiple ways of doing things. For instance, you could press Win+R on your keyboard and then type in <span style="font-family: courier new , courier;">cmd</span> in the Open field of the dialog box that appears and then click <span style="font-family: courier new , courier;">OK</span>. (Here's a link to the list which includes this and some other useful hotkeys in Windows: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/12445/windows-keyboard-shortcuts" title="Keyboard shortcuts in Windows" target="_blank">https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/12445/windows-keyboard-shortcuts</a> )<br>8) Change the directory to the folder where you extracted the contents of the ZIP file. You need to type cd <em><span style="font-family: courier new , courier;">folder_name</span></em> where <em>folder_name</em> is the name of the folder you want to change to. Please note that if <em>folder_name</em> contains spaces, you need to enclose the entire <em>folder_name</em> in quotes.<br>9) Type in a command to launch Dafny.exe giving the file name with your Dafny program as a parameter. (Please note that Dafny would expect the file to have a ".dfy" extension.)<br><br>Here's an example of how this works.<br><br>Downloaded the ZIP and extracted it into<span style="font-family: courier new , courier;"> c:\Program Files\dafny\</span>. Launched the command prompt and typed <span style="font-family: courier new , courier;">cd "c:\Program Files\dafny\"</span>. Created a simple Dafny example in file <span style="font-family: courier new , courier;">c:\CSCI-2600\Lab01\Lab01.dfy</span>. The contents of the file is as follows:<br><br><span style="font-family: courier new , courier;">method DivisionByZero(x: int) returns (y: int)</span><br><span style="font-family: courier new , courier;">&nbsp; requires x == 1 || x == -2</span><br><span style="font-family: courier new , courier;">&nbsp; ensures y == 0</span><br><span style="font-family: courier new , courier;">{</span><br><span style="font-family: courier new , courier;">&nbsp; y := x + 4;</span><br><span style="font-family: courier new , courier;">&nbsp; if (x &gt; 0) {</span><br><span style="font-family: courier new , courier;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; y := x*x - 1;</span><br><span style="font-family: courier new , courier;">&nbsp; } else {</span><br><span style="font-family: courier new , courier;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; y := y + x;</span><br><span style="font-family: courier new , courier;">&nbsp; }</span><br><span style="font-family: courier new , courier;">}</span><br><br>Verified myDafny program by typing the command, like that:<br><br><span style="font-family: courier new , courier;">c:\Program Files\dafny&gt;Dafny c:\CSCI-2600\Lab01\Lab01.dfy</span><br><span style="font-family: courier new , courier;">Dafny 3.1.0.30421</span><br><br><span style="font-family: courier new , courier;">Dafny program verifier finished with 1 verified, 0 errors</span><br><span style="font-family: courier new , courier;">Compiled assembly into Lab01.dll</span><br><br>That's it! Hopefully this how-to would be helpful to at least some of you.<br><br>If you notice any mistakes in this how-to or have any suggestions/improvements/corrections, please let me know.</p>
